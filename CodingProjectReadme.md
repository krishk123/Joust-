<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: [[Joust]]</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: My interaction is going to be between two people, who will be balancing on their platform and try to knock each other off their platform by hitting pads. 

<strong>Description</strong>: This is inspired from the American Gladiator show, and I want to make it so that two people as well as have fun, look silly playing this game so they can have a laugh.
